# DMA (aka Demitri Muna Attributes)

## What is this?

This is a hack of the [.astronomy9](http://dotastronomy9.saao.ac.za) conference in Cape Town, South Africa.
It is inspired by the technological genome of [Demitri Muna](http://muna.com), one of the [.astronomy](https://www.dotastronomy.com) veterans who turns out to be a really helpful resource for pretty much any hacks, including non-tech ones, and for group photos.

We share lots of DNA but how much DMA do we share?

How do we mutate?

What is the impat of a mutation?

PS: This may be the creepiest hack of .astro ever - apologies.
