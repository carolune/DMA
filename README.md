# DMA (aka Demitri Muna Attributes)

## What is this?

This is a hack of the [.astronomy9](http://dotastronomy9.saao.ac.za) conference in Cape Town, South Africa.
It is inspired by the technological genome of [Demitri Muna](http://muna.com), one of the [.astronomy](https://www.dotastronomy.com) veterans who turns out to be a really helpful resource for pretty much any hacks, including non-tech ones, and for group photos.

## The DMA

I have sequenced the DMA and here is what I found, along with resources on how to pick up the skills in the DMA.
