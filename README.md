# DMA (aka Demitri Muna Attributes)

## What is this?

This is a hack of the [.astronomy9](http://dotastronomy9.saao.ac.za) conference in Cape Town, South Africa.
It is inspired by the technological genome of [Demitri Muna](http://muna.com), one of the [.astronomy](https://www.dotastronomy.com) veterans who turns out to be a really helpful resource for pretty much any hacks, including non-tech ones, and for group photos.

# Conclusion

We share lots of DNA but how much DMA do we share? How do we mutate? What is the impact of a mutation?


Thank you [@demitrimuna](https://twitter.com/demitrimuna) for being a willing volunteer.


PS: This may be the creepiest hack of .astro ever - apologies.
